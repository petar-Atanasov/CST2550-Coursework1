A small library needs a system to track the details of their available books and members. They provided
you with the data source CSV file. The file contains details of all books that are available for members
to borrow and return within three days. It is made available to you for implementaƟon and tesƟng,
but the system should allow any file to be used.

A small library has these types of books that are available to borrow for members only:
1. Science ficƟon
2. SaƟre
3. Drama
4. AcƟon and Adventure
5. Romance
6. Mystery
7. Horror
8. Health
9. Guide
10. Diaries
11. Comics
12. Journals
13. Biographies
14. Fantasy
15. History
16. Science
17. Art
All books have an id, name, author, type, and page count.
The program will only be used by the librarian at the library (not by customers/members) and will not
take payment details.
The system should include the following funcƟonality:
 Add a member – the librarian should be able to create a new member and display the new
member’s details directly following the creaƟon of the member.
 Issue a book to a member – the librarian should be able to issue a book to an individual
member with a valid due date from the date of issue (3 days).
 Return a book – the librarian should be able to return a book from an individual member.
 Display all books borrowed by any individual member – the librarian should be able to display
all books borrowed by an individual member.
 Calculate a fine for any individual member for overdue book(s) – upon the return of a book, if
the book’s due date has expired, a fine should be calculated based on a rate of £1 per day
overdue.
